# Neural-Style-Transfer

Implementing the Style Transfer Algorithm using Pytorch. Reference paper: A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style
The algorithm involves content loss and style loss. Content loss involves the feature space matrix from a higher layer. The style loss involves Gram matrices of the feature space matrices from different layers. Gram matrice is similar to correlation matrice. Capture the texture of the image rather than the content.
